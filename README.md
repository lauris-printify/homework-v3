# Printify REST API

This API is written in PHP using Symfony framework.
Project runs on nginx server, php scripts are ran by php-fpm and data is stored in mysql. Phpmyadmin is accessable too.

This is an API which allows to add users and products and orders connected to them.

## Installation

Clone this repository

```
git@github.com:lauris-printify/homework-v3.git
```

In root directory run

```
composer install -d api
docker-compose up
```

## Database setup

This project uses mysql together with doctrine.

After executing **docker-compose up** mysql is setup from **docker/backup/mysql/api.sql** file.

All work occurs in **printify_api** database.

In it four tables - user, product, order and relation - are automatically created empty.

**user** - stores created users

**product** - stores products submitted by the user

**order** - stores order submitted by the user

**relation** - links an order with it's products

Connection to **mysql** docker container is defined in **api/env** file's DATABASE_URL field


## Testing

Tests are written with phpunit and are located in api/tests.

For your convenience, you can create an alias in your shell

```
alias phpunit='./api/vendor/bin/phpunit'
```
so that you can simply write phpunit from the root folder and tests will be executed.

Testing is done within in-memory storage. Production repositories are being simulated by test repositories stored in api/src/Repository/Test to improve testing time while testing. Production repositories are stored in api/src/Repository/Prod.

This is set up in api/config/services_test.yml file where interfaces point to test repositories. api/config/services.yml interfaces point to production repositories.
