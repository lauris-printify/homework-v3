# Printify REST API

API for creating users, products and orders for an e-commerce store.

- Written in PHP using Symfony framework
- Runs on nginx server
- Scripts executed by php-fpm
- Data stored using mysql
- Phpmyadmin enabled
- Deployed using Docker

## Installation

Clone this repository

```
git@github.com:lauris-printify/homework-v3.git
```

Switch to project folder

```
cd homework-v3
```

Install dependencies

```
composer install -d api
```

Run the app using docker

```
docker-compose up
```

## Database setup

This project uses mysql together with doctrine within the symfony framework.

After executing **docker-compose up** mysql is setup from **docker/backup/mysql/api.sql** file.

All work occurs in **printify_api** database.

Four tables are created:

- user : stores created users

- product : stores products submitted by the user

- order : stores orders submitted by the user

- relation : links an order with it's products

Connection to **mysql** docker container is defined in **api/env** file's DATABASE_URL field.


## Testing

Tests are written with phpunit and are located in **api/tests**.

> Testing is done within memory to reduce test time.

> api/config/services_test.yml : declares which repositories are used for testing. Production repositories are being simulated by test repositories stored in api/src/Repository/Test.

> api/config/services.yml : declares which repositories are used for production. Production repositories are stored in api/src/Repository/Prod.


With docker running, switch to api folder

```
cd api
```

Create an alias in your shell for more convenient use

```
alias phpunit='vendor/bin/phpunit'
```

Run tests

```
phpunit
```

## Usage

- Endpoints can be accessed via port 8098 : http://localhost:8098/{endpoint}

- All JSON keys can be a combination of upper and lowercase letters. If required key is "name", then API accepts "Name", "nAmE" etc.

```
{
	"name" : "John",
	"surname" : "Doe"
}
```
```
{
	"nAmE" : "John",
	"surname" : "Doe"
}
```

Both examples are valid.

- API ignores redundant keys. If name and surname keys are required, but user also adds birthdate key, the API only grabs keys it needs.

- If invalid endpoint or non existing user, product or order are requested, API returns an empty body with 404 status code.

 - Accessing '/' displays HTML welcome page.

## Endpoints

### 3.1 Create a new order
endpoint : /users/{id}/orders

method : POST

url : http://localhost:8098/users/{id}/orders

request body if user with id of 1 exists:

```
{
	"shipToAddress": {
		"name" : "John",
		"surname" : "Doe",
		"street" : "Palm street 255",
		"state" : "NY",
		"zip" : "12315",
		"country" : "US",
		"phone" : "917-568-2970"
	},
	"lineItems": [
		{"id": 1, "quantity": 1},
		{"id": 2, "quantity": 1}
	],
	"info":
	{
		"expressShipping": true
	}
}
```

Order request body consists of two mandatory parts - shipToAddress (shipping address) and lineItems (products within the order).

shipToAddress

Orders are grouped into international and domestic (US) orders.

Domestic order's shipToAddress must include all keys just like in the example, but for international order "state" and "zip" keys are optional.


lineItems

Each object within lineItems array represents a product within order.

id is the id of a product that user has created.

quantity is how many units of the product are requested.

info

info part is only applicable to US orders and is optional. If expressShipping is set to true, then express shipping is enabled for the order. In that case, shipping costs for each product is 10$ (1000 cents).

If the user has sufficient funds, order is created. Once it is created, funds from user are substracted.

response body includes request data, but also expands on each line item and adds information about order under info section.

{
    "shipToAddress": {
        "name": "John",
        "surname": "Doe",
